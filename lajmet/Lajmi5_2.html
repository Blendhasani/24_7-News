            A type of light commonly observed in astrophysics experiments and nuclear reactors can help detect cancer.<br> 
            In a clinical trial, a prototype of an imaging machine that relies on this usually bluish light, called Cerenkov<br> 
            radiation, successfully captured the presence and location of cancer patients’ tumors, researchers report April<br> 
            11 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.<br><br>
            When compared with standard scans of the tumors, the Cerenkov light images were classified as “acceptable”<br> 
            or higher for 90 percent of patients, says Magdalena Skubal, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering<br> 
            Cancer Center in New York City.<br><br>
            Cerenkov radiation is generated by high-speed particles traveling faster than light through a material, such as<br> 
            bodily tissue (SN: 8/5/21). In Cerenkov luminescence imaging, or CLI, particles released by radiotracers cause<br> 
            the target tissue to vibrate and relax in a way that emits light, which is then captured by a camera.<br><br>
            Between May 2018 and March 2020, in the largest clinical trial of its kind to date, 96 participants underwent<br> 
            both CLI and standard imaging, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography, or PET/CT.<br> 
            Participants with a variety of diagnoses, including lymphoma, thyroid cancer and metastatic prostate cancer,<br> 
            received one of five radiotracers and were then imaged by the prototype — a camera in a light-proof enclosure.<br><br>
            Skubal and colleagues found that CLI detected all radiotracers, suggesting that the technology is more versatile<br> 
            than PET/CT scans, which work with only some radiotracers.<br><br>
            CLI images aren’t as precise as those from PET/CT scans. But CLI could be used as an initial diagnostic test or to<br> 
            assess the general size of a tumor undergoing treatment, says study coauthor Edwin Pratt, also of Memorial<br> 
            Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It would be a quick and easy way to see if there’s something off … <br>
            [that warrants] further investigation,” Pratt says.
