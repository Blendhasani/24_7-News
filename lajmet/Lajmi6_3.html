            Get up and move -- even small doses of physical activity, such as brisk walking,<br> 
            may substantially lower the risk of depression, according to a new data analysis.<br><br>
            "Most benefits are realized when moving from no activity to at least some," the study authors wrote.<br><br>
            Recommended levels of exercise in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,<br> 
            include aerobic activity at moderate levels (such as a brisk walk) for 2.5 hours a week, along with a workout of all major muscle groups twice a week.<br><br>
            Alternatively, a person can choose a vigorous aerobic exercise, such as running, for 1.25 hours each week, along with the same amount of strength training.<br><br>
            Moderate to vigorous exercise is good for us, according to the CDC. It improves sleep; lowers blood pressure;<br> 
            protects against heart disease, diabetes and cancer; reduces stress; boosts mood; and fights anxiety and depression.<br><br>
            But in today's busy world, many people find it difficult to fit in a jog or a visit to the gym.<br> 
            Add depression to the mix, and the motivation for exercise drops even further, experts say.<br><br>
            <h3><b>Every little bit helps</b></h3><br>
            The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at 15 studies<br> 
            involving over 190,000 people to determine how much exercise was needed to reduce depression.<br><br>
            Adults who did activities equivalent to 1.25 hours of brisk walking per week had an 18% lower<br> 
            risk of depression compared with those who did not exercise, the study said.<br><br>
            Moving up to an "activity volume equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking per week<br> 
            was associated with 25% lower risk of depression," the study authors said.<br><br>
            The benefits were strongest when a person transitioned from being a couch potato<br> 
            to adding movement to the day, the study said. However, exercising <br>
            over the recommended levels did not provide any additional benefits.<br><br>
            "Our findings therefore have important new implications for health practitioners making lifestyle recommendations,<br> 
            especially to inactive individuals who may perceive the current recommended target (of exercise) as unrealistic," the authors wrote.
