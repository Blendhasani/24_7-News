            One of Apple's top suppliers is stopping work at its factories in and around Shanghai<br> 
            as the city of 25 million people remains under a strict Covid lockdown.<br><br>
            Pegatron announced Tuesday that it had suspended production at its facility in China's <br>
            largest city, as well as the nearby city of Kunshan, until further notice..<br><br>
            "The date of factory resumption is to be advised by the local government," the company said<br>
            in a statement, adding that it would work with officials to resume operations "as soon as possible."<br><br>
            It was not immediately clear which types of manufacturing would be affected. Pegatron,<br>
            a Taiwanese company that is known for making iPhones and other electronics, had previously<br> 
            been allowed to continue operating in Shanghai under a closed loop system that would keep essential<br> 
            workers in the factory and other personnel out â€” according to reports from multiple outlets, including Bloomberg.<br><br>
            Even before Pegatron's announcement, Apple (AAPL) was having to deal with similar snags<br> 
            in its supply chain. Last month, Foxconn, its other big Taiwanese manufacturer, suspended <br>
            operations in Shenzhen because of a lockdown in the city just north of Hong Kong.
