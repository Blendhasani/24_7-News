            Contrary to worries among some doctors and the public, drinking coffee may actually<br>
        protect your heart instead of causing or worsening heart problems.<br><br>
        Drinking two to three cups of coffee daily has been associated with a 10% to 15% <br>
        lower risk of getting heart disease, heart failure or a heart rhythm problem,<br>
        or dying early for any reason, according to three research abstracts published Thursday.<br><br>
        "Because coffee can quicken heart rate, some people worry that drinking it could trigger<br> 
        or worsen certain heart issues. This is where general medical advice to stop drinking coffee may come from," <br>
        Dr. Peter M. Kistler, the study's senior author, said in a statement. Kistler is head of clinical<br> 
        electrophysiology research at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute and head of electrophysiology<br> 
        at The Alfred hospital in Melbourne, Australia.<br><br>
        "We found coffee drinking had either a neutral effect -- meaning that it did no harm -- or was<br> 
        associated with benefits to heart health," said Kistler, a leading arrhythmia expert who is also<br> 
        a professor of medicine at both the University of Melbourne and Monash University.<br><br>
        For all the studies, Kistler and the other researchers used data from UK Biobank, which follows the<br> 
        health outcomes of more than 500,000 people for at least 10 years. When joining the registry,<br> 
        participants reported where their coffee consumption fell on a range from up to a cup to six cups<br> 
        or more daily. The authors of the current research wanted to examine the relationship between coffee<br> 
        drinking and heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); cardiovascular disease, including<br> 
        coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke; and total and heart-related deaths among people with and without heart disease.
