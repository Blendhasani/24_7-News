            The word "routine" can bring to mind words such as mundane or ordinary. During the pandemic's disruptions to daily life,<br> 
            routines may have felt boring and restrictive. However, as an occupational therapist and researcher of the impact of activity<br> 
            and participation on mental health, I know that routines can be powerful tools. They can support cognitive function,<br> 
            boost health and provide meaningful activities and social opportunities.<br><br>
            Early in the pandemic, researchers pointed to the value of daily routines to cope with change. As the two-year anniversary<br> 
            of the pandemic coincided with the relaxation of public health measures across the country, reflecting on routines and their value<br> 
            has been useful when moving toward a "new normal."<br><br>
            <h3><b>Routines support cognitive function</b></h3><br>
            First, having a daily routine and regular habits supports cognitive function and may even free people up to be more creative.<br> 
            Research has found that having regular work processes allows workers to spend less cognitive energy on recurring tasks,<br> 
            which can support focus and creativity for more complex tasks.<br><br>
            Think of typical morning routines that existed before the pandemic: helping family members get on their way,<br> 
            taking a usual route to work, grabbing a warm beverage along the way, saying hello to coworkers,<br> 
            flipping on a computer or opening a calendar. Having habits such as these can set the stage for a productive workday.<br><br>
            A review of the daily rituals of influential artists found that many artists have well-defined work routines that may support<br> 
            their creativity rather than constrain it. Memory research shows that regular routines and habits can support older adults<br> 
            to function better in their home environments.<br><br>
            If taking medications at the same time and putting the keys in their spot is part of a daily routine,<br> 
            less energy will be spent looking for lost objects and worrying about maintaining one's health,<br> 
            freeing up time for other things people want to do in their day.
