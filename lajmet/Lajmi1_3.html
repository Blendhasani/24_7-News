         <b>Maria says she grew up in a "loving" Catholic family on the east coast of America, with large Sunday dinners a weekly staple. <br>
             Her parents had a good marriage and she wanted that respect and closeness in her own relationship.</b>

             <br><br>When she met her husband in her early twenties, it felt like love.

            <br><br> But romance quickly soured, turning in to a 25-year tale of abuse and control. First there was the name-calling. Then, complete control of her finances, her movements, and eventually over their three sons.

            <br><br>Her husband objected to her having a job where she would interact with other people and he banned her from using the computer.

            <br><br>"He would call me fat every day, he would barricade me out of the house when he was angry" she recalls.
            <br><br>   Eventually, the financial abuse ramped up. First, he would take away her paycheque from her cleaning job, then, he applied for credit cards in Maria's name using her social security number.

            <br><br>Six years ago, Maria finally broke down when she heard him say he wanted her dead. With the help of her church and family she slowly formulated an escape plan.

            <br><br>After losing their property to foreclosure, she eventually moved in with her sister. She got a laptop for the first time and finally had the freedom to set up a Facebook account. She started dating.
      
            <br><br>But soon, her ex-husband would quote her messages to a man she was seeing. Her ex also started turning up wherever she was.

            <br><br>She would suddenly spot him driving behind her on a motorway. Once, she was so terrified that he was chasing her and could possibly pull a gun, that she called the police.

            <br><br>Although she didn't press charges, the stalking eventually subsided and she moved further away. But she found out she had been a victim of so-called stalkerware.
            <br><br>Stalkerware is commercially available software that's used to spy on another person via their device - usually a phone - without their consent.

            <br><br>It can allow the user to view someone else's messages, location, photos, files, and even eavesdrop on conversations in the phone's vicinity.
            <br><br>To help tackle the problem Eva Galperin formed the Coalition Against Stalkerware in 2019.

            <br><br>She decided to set up the group after looking into reports from a number of alleged rape victims, who were terrified their lives could continue to be ruined by their abuser using tech. When someone has access to your phone the potential for exploitation is huge, she explains. For example a victim could be blackmailed with threats to share intimate photos.

            <br><br>Ms Galperin says that in the domestic abuse cases she encounters, "some level of tech-enabled abuse is almost universally there", and that this often includes stalkerware.
            <br><br>"It's often linked to the most violent cases - because it is such a powerful tool of coercive control," she adds.

            <br><br>Research suggests that proliferation of stalkerware is a growing problem: A study by <b>Norton Labs</b> found that the number of devices indicating that they had stalkerware installed rose by 63% between September 2020 and May 2021.
