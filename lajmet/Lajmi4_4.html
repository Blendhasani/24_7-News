            <h2>Nokia and Ericsson halt new business in Russia. Is Huawei next?</h2><br>
            Nokia has announced its exit from Russia, while rival Ericsson is putting its business<br> 
            there on hold indefinitely, throwing into doubt the country's ability to build super-fast 5G networks.<br><br>
            The Finnish telecom company announced on Tuesday that staying in Russia would "not be possible"<br> 
            given President Vladimir Putin's ongoing assault on Ukraine.<br><br>
            "Over the last weeks we have suspended deliveries, stopped new business and are moving<br> 
            our limited R&D activities out of Russia," Nokia said in a statement. "We can now announce we will exit the Russian market."<br><br>
            That leaves China's Huawei as the only top 3 global provider of 5G networks still active in the country.<br><br>
            Western governments have imposed several rounds of punishing sanctions on Russia since the invasion,<br> 
            including restrictions on imports of advanced technology into the country.<br><br>
            But they have emphasized the need, on humanitarian grounds, to maintain functioning telecoms networks to enable Russians to access information from abroad.<br><br>
            Nokia (NOK) said it would "aim to provide the necessary support to maintain the networks" and was applying<br> 
            for licenses to ensure compliance with sanctions.<br><br>
            Ericsson (ERIC), meanwhile, said on Monday that it would suspend its business in the country<br> 
            indefinitely and place its workers on paid leave. It had already halted all deliveries to customers in Russia in late February.<br><br>
            Western companies have quit their Russian businesses in droves following the start of the invasion in<br> 
            late February. Russia now faces the onerous task of building homegrown alternatives to Western<br> 
            products and services, possibly with the help of Chinese suppliers.<br><br> 
            This task could extend to its next generation internet. Nokia and Ericsson are two of the world's<br> 
            biggest providers of 5G mobile networks â€” the ultra-fast internet that will underpin a raft of future technologies.
