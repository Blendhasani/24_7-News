                <b>Sergio Aguero is set to announce his retirement on Wednesday less than six months after<br> 
                    joining Barcelona, reports Guillem Balague.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                The 33-year-old has struggled with injuries and health problems since moving to Spain,<br> 
                making only five appearances for the Catalan side.
                <br>
                <br>
                In his final game, on 30 October, he was substituted and taken to hospital after<br> 
                experiencing <b>"chest discomfort".</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Aguero finishes his career with 427 goals in 786 games.
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"><li><b>How Aguero went from 'worst trainer in the world to Man City 'icon'</b></li></ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b style="font-size: 25px;">A Premier League legend</b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                While Aguero's time at Barcelona has not gone to plan, there can be no doubting his status<br> 
                as one of the foremost strikers of the 21st Century.
                <br>
                <br>
                After starting out with Independiente in Argentina, he moved to Atletico Madrid, winning<br> 
                the Europa League in 2010 and scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances.
                <br>
                <br>
                That record attracted the interest of an upwardly mobile Manchester City, who paid a<br> 
                reported Â£38m to bring him to Etihad Stadium. He would go on to become a club and<br> 
                Premier League legend during a 10-year spell in England.
                <br>
                <br>
                Aguero left City in the summer having broken their all-time scoring record, with 260 goals<br> 
                in 390 games, including 16 hat-tricks.
                <br>
                <br>
                He is the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history with 184 goals, nine<br> 
                more than France and Arsenal great Thierry Henry.
                <br>
                <br>
                Only Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208) and Andrew Cole (187) have scored more in<br> 
                the competition.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b style="font-size: 25px;">A sad end with Barcelona</b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                Aguero's great friendship with compatriot Lionel Messi meant a move to Barcelona was an<br> 
                attractive one after it became clear he would be allowed to leave Manchester City.
                <br>
                <br>
                He had won over City boss Pep Guardiola, who initially had concerns about the striker's<br> 
                ability to fit into his style of play, but injuries limited Aguero's playing time during his final<br> 
                season at Etihad Stadium.
                <br>
                <br>
                But the switch to Barcelona went badly from the start. The club's financial problems meant<br> 
                there were problems registering their new signings, including Aguero.
                <br>
                <br>
                And those same issues led to the departure of Messi to Paris St-Germain.
