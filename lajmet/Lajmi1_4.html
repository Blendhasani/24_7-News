        <b>Football clubs have potentially made hundreds of millions of pounds selling controversial crypto "fan tokens".</b> 
        <br><br>Analysis commissioned by 24/7 News estimates more than &#163;262m ($350m) has been spent on the virtual currencies. 
        <br><br>Some of the tokens are marketed as offering real-world perks to the buyer.
        <br><br>But critics say these perks are insignificant - one offered the chance to vote for songs to be played in <br> stadiums - and clubs have insufficient protection for supporters.
        <br><br>So far, across the five major European leagues 24 different clubs have launched or are considering fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides.
        <br><br>Most offer tokens akin to a club-specific crypto-currency - virtual coins can be bought and sold and their value rise and fall depending on supply and demand.
        <br><br>Some clubs, such as Manchester City, also sell digital collectibles known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).
        <br><br> Most of the clubs offering fan tokens have signed up to a company called Socios that organises the initial sale and subsequent trading of the virtual coins - but other platforms, including Binance and Bitci, are growing too.
        <br><br> Socios told BBC News it had sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app. It would not say how much money goes directly to clubs.
        <br><br>Buyers must first convert their money into the company's own crypto-currency, Chiliz.
        <br><br>The research, by crypto-analysts Protos, suggests many buyers are speculatively trading their tokens like other crypto-currencies in an attempt to make money.
