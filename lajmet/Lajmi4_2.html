            Google on Wednesday said it plans to invest $9.5 billion in US offices and data<br> 
            centers around the country this year, up from more than $7 billion in 2021.<br><br>
            The big bet on office space comes as Google (GOOG) is embracing a hybrid work model.<br> 
            The Alphabet-owned company has called for many of its employees to work in an office three days a week after two years of being fully remote.<br><br>
            "It might seem counterintuitive to step up our investment in physical offices even as we embrace more<br> 
            flexibility in how we work," Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet and Google, said in a blog post Wednesday.<br> 
            "Yet we believe it's more important than ever to invest in our campuses and that doing so will make for better<br> 
            products, a greater quality of life for our employees, and stronger communities."<br><br>
            Google said it will open an office in Atlanta this year and continue to develop and expand office<br> 
            space in Austin and New York. Google also said it plans to continue investing in data centers<br> 
            in Iowa, Nebraska and Tennessee, among other states.<br><br>
            As part of the announcement, Google said it expects to create at least 12,000 new full-time jobs at the company this year.<br><br>
            Google and other tech companies were among the first businesses to shift to remote work when the pandemic<br> 
            hit in early 2020. But that shift always appeared to be temporary. Like others in Silicon Valley,<br> 
            Google had previously invested billions in expansive campuses and lavish office perks for workers.
