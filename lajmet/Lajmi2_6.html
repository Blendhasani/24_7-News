                <b>Covid-19 cases and deaths are rising fast in Africa as the continent battles<br> 
                    a third wave of infections.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                The number of deaths recorded for the past week has risen by more than 40%<br> 
                compared with the previous week, according to the World Health Organization<br> 
                (WHO).
                <br>
                <br>
                New and faster spreading variants such as the highly transmissible Delta<br> 
                variant are appearing in more and more countries.
                <br>
                <br>
                Less than 2% of the continent has been fully vaccinated.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b style="font-size: 30px;">Where are cases and deaths rising?</b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                New cases have been increasing for eight weeks running and rose by 13% over<br> 
                the past week compared with the previous week, according to the Africa<br> 
                Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
                <br>
                <br>
                The countries reporting the highest number of deaths over the week include<br> 
                Namibia, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hospital admissions in around 10 countries have increased rapidly and at least<br> 
                six countries are facing shortages of intensive care unit beds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Demand for medical oxygen is estimated to be 50% higher than at the same<br> 
                time in 2020, yet supply has not kept up.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Deaths have climbed steeply for the past five weeks. This is a clear warning<br> 
                sign that hospitals in the most impacted countries are reaching a breaking<br> 
                point," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.
                <br>
                <br>
                The third wave has seen cases rising faster compared with the previous waves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Over the past month, Africa recorded an additional one million cases, the<br> 
                shortest time ever it has taken to add another million cases.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the second wave daily cases peaked at 28 cases per one million<br> 
                population while during the ongoing third wave the rate stands at about 33<br> 
                cases per 1 million population, the Africa CDC says.
                <br>
                <br>
                "The worst is yet to come as the fast-moving third wave continues to gain<br> 
                speed and new ground," says Moeti.
