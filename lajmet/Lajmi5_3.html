            Fragmenting planets sweeping extremely close to their stars might be the cause of mysterious cosmic blasts of radio waves.<br><br>
            Milliseconds-long fast radio bursts, or FRBs, erupt from distant cosmic locales. Some of these bursts blast only<br> 
            once and others repeat. A new computer calculation suggests the repetitive kind could be due to a planet<br> 
            interacting with its magnetic host star, researchers report in the March 20 Astrophysical Journal.<br><br>
            FRBs are relative newcomers to astronomical research. Ever since the first was discovered in 2007, researchers<br> 
            have added hundreds to the tally. Scientists have theorized dozens of ways the two different types of FRBs can<br> 
            occur, and nearly all theories include compact, magnetic stellar remnants known as neutron stars. Some ideas<br> 
            include powerful radio flares from magnetars, the most magnetic neutron stars imaginable (SN: 6/4/20). Others<br> 
            suggest a fast-spinning neutron star, or even asteroids interacting with magnetars (SN: 2/23/22).<br><br>
            “How fast radio bursts are produced is still up for debate,” says astronomer Yong-Feng Huang of Nanjing University in China.<br><br>
            Huang and his colleagues considered a new way to make the repeating flares: interactions between a neutron<br> 
            star and an orbiting planet (SN: 3/5/94). Such planets can get exceedingly close to these stars, so the team<br> 
            calculated what might happen to a planet in a highly elliptical orbit around a neutron star. When the planet<br> 
            swings very close to its star, the star’s gravity pulls more on the planet than when the planet is at its farthest<br> 
            orbital point, elongating and distorting it. This “tidal pull,” Huang says, will rip some small clumps off the planet.<br> 
            Each clump in the team’s calculation is just a few kilometers wide and maybe one-millionth the mass of the planet, he adds.<br><br>
            Then the fireworks start. Neutron stars spew a wind of radiation and particles, much like our own sun but more<br> 
            extreme. When one of these clumps passes through that stellar wind, the interaction “can produce really strong<br> 
            radio emissions,” Huang says. If that happens when the clump appears to pass in front of the star from Earth’s<br> 
            perspective, we might see it as a fast radio burst. Each burst in a repeating FRB signal could be caused by one of<br> 
            these clumps interacting with the neutron star’s wind during each close planet pass, he says. After that<br> 
            interaction, what remains of the clump drifts in orbit around the star, but away from Earth’s perspective, so we never see it again.
