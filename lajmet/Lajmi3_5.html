            <p>
                <b>Last summer, two weeks before the Jamaican Olympic trials, Elaine<br> 
                    Thompson-Herah's Achilles was hurting. Again.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                The injury had flared on and off for almost five years, ever since she did the 100m-200m<br> 
                double at Rio 2016.
                <br>
                <br>
                The latest bout of pain was intense. And the doubts bubbled up fast. She feared, as the<br> 
                tendon stayed tender, that she might miss the trials, ending her title defence before it had<br> 
                begun.
                <br>
                <br>
                As she rested and iced up her heel, she knew she had to fix something else as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                "My mind was not in the right place," she told <b>BBC Radio 5 Live's All About podcast</b>. "I<br> 
                had to change that talk in my head."
                <br>
                <br>
                Every morning, Thompson-Herah would wake, pray and read the bible. She started<br> 
                listening to a particular spiritual - Anywhere You Lead Me I Will Go by Nigerian gospel<br> 
                singer Mercy Chinwo - on repeat.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her faith in God bolstered her faith in herself. But if the meek inherit the earth, a little more<br> 
                swagger helps an Olympic title defence.
                <br>
                <br>
                After every practice session, she would reach for her phone, open up the notes app and<br> 
                write down and read out a series of affirmations.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I will run 10.5. I will run 21.5. I can do it. I am a winner. I am a champion,"<br> 
                began the list.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I will be the fastest woman alive. Say it, believe it, work for it and pray for it. I<br> 
                will be the double Olympic champion. Today is my day. I am the greatest," it<br> 
                ended.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You write it down, you talk it, you say it, and naturally you will believe,"<br> 
                Thompson-Herah, 29, explained.
