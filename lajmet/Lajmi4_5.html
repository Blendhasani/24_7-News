            Nearly two years before Japanese fashion titan Yusaku Maezawa embarked on his recent tourist<br> 
            visit to the International Space Station, he made global headlines for launching a worldwide<br> 
            search for a "life partner" to go to the moon with him.<br><br>
            In his online appeal for love, Maezawa, who was 44 at the time, said he hoped finding a companion<br> 
            would ease the "feelings of loneliness and emptiness" surging within him. A few months later, however,<br> 
            he abruptly called off this quest for a romantic partner due to unspecified personal reasons.<br><br>
            Now, it appears Maezawa is betting robots may be able to fill the hole in one's heart.<br><br>
            The eccentric billionaire, who made his fortune through the Japanese e-commerce fashion site Zozotown,<br> 
            announced last month that his investment fund is buying Japanese robotics startup Groove X, which makes<br> 
            a product called Lovot, a combination of the words "love" and "robot." Terms of the deal were not disclosed.<br><br>
            The pet-sized companion robots aim to stir an "instinct to love" in its human customers, according to<br> 
            the company's website, with potential use cases in nursing homes and with children. As the pandemic raged,<br> 
            the so-called "emotional" robots also found new purpose in providing companionship to those who have been forced<br> 
            to stay apart from others, according to the company.<br><br>
            The wide-eyed devices roll around on wheels and have more than 50 sensors to respond to stimuli from humans<br> 
            (whom it distinguishes via a thermal camera) through machine learning technology, according to the company.<br> 
            The robot is currently only available for sale in Japan. The price starts at $2,825 for a single<br> 
            device, plus a monthly service fee of approximately $80.<br><br>
            Groove X was founded in 2015 by CEO Kaname Hayashi, a SoftBank veteran who developed the humanoid robot Pepper.<br> 
            The firm received funding from the Japanese government and unveiled its first Lovot device to the local market in 2019.<br> 
            These robots don't seek to provide any convenience or practical purpose. In fact, the company has previously<br> 
            described it as "not a useful robot." The robot was "born for just one reason â€” to be loved by you," the company said.<br><br>
            "I never imagined that a robot would heal me," Maezawa said in a statement announcing his fund's acquisition of Groove X.<br> 
            While the robot "can't clean or do work," Maezawa said he sees "big potential in a presence that can make people feel happy,<br> 
            particularly at this time," alluding to the global Covid-19 pandemic.
