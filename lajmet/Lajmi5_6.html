            On Mars, the speed of sound depends on its pitch.<br><br>
            All sound travels slower through Mars’ air compared with Earth’s. But the higher-pitched clacks of a laser<br> 
            zapping rocks travels slightly faster in the thin Martian atmosphere than the lower-pitched hum of the Ingenuity<br> 
            helicopter, researchers report April 1 in Nature.<br><br>
            These sound speed measurements from NASA’s Perseverance rover are part of a broader effort to monitor<br> 
            minute-by-minute changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, like during wind gusts, on the Red Planet.<br><br>
            “The wind is the sound of science for us,” says astrophysicist Baptiste Chide of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.<br><br>
            To listen to the wind, Perseverance carries two microphones. One was meant to record audio during the<br> 
            mission’s complex entry, descent and landing, and while it didn’t work as hoped, it is now turned on<br> 
            occasionally to listen to the rover’s vitals (SN: 2/22/21; SN: 2/17/21). The other microphone is part of the rover’s<br> 
            SuperCam instrument, a mast-mounted mishmash of cameras and other sensors used to understand the properties of materials on the planet’s surface.<br><br>
            But these microphones also pick up other sounds, such as those made by the rover itself as its wheels crunch<br> 
            the surface, and by Perseverance’s flying companion, the robotic helicopter Ingenuity. The SuperCam<br> 
            instrument, for example, has a laser, which Perseverance fires at interesting rocks for<br> 
            further analysis (SN: 7/28/20). The microphone on SuperCam captures sounds from those laser shots, which helps<br> 
            researchers learn about the hardness of the target material, says planetary scientist<br> 
            Naomi Murdoch of the Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace in Toulouse, France.<br><br>
            Murdoch, Chide and their colleagues listened to the laser’s clack-clack when zapping rocks. (“It doesn’t do,<br> 
            really, ‘pew pew,’” Murdoch says). When the laser hits a target, that blast creates a sound wave. Because<br> 
            scientists know when the laser fires and how far away a target is, they can measure the speed at which that<br> 
            sound wave travels through the air toward the SuperCam microphone.<br><br>
            The speed of this sound is about 250 meters per second, the team reports. That’s slower than on Earth,<br> 
            where sound travels through the air at about 340 m/s.
