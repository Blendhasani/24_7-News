                    Coronavirus: Why are infections rising again in US?

                <b style="font-size: 30px;">What's the overall picture?</b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                With about 7.5 million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of <br>
                confirmed infections in the world - about one fifth of the global total despite<br> 
                having only 4% of the population.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the initial spike in late March, social distancing restrictions gradually<br> 
                brought infections to heel. By May, case numbers had stabilised. But as states<br> 
                peeled back lockdown measures, cases began to rise, reaching a countrywide<br>
                high in July.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b style="font-size: 30px;">Why are cases rising?</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                It's difficult to explain precisely why.
                <br>
                <br>
                One contributing factor has been the return to school for US students.
                <br>
                <br>
                A recent study from the US Centers for Disease Control on the almost<br> 
                100,000 coronavirus cases reported between 2 August and 5 September -<br> 
                around when college students began their return to school - found that<br> 
                weekly cases among those aged 18-22 increased by 55% nationally.
                <br>
                <br>
                The greatest increases came from the Northeast (which includes New York,<br> 
                Connecticut and New Jersey) and the Midwest, which is a region located west<br> 
                of the Northeast, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.
                <br>
                <br>
                There have now been more than 130,000 cases identified at more than 1,300<br> 
                American colleges, according to reporting from the New York Times.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another compounding factor is the change in seasons. Top US virus expert Dr<br> 
                Anthony Fauci said last month that we should plan to "hunker down" through<br> 
                the autumn and winter. "It's not going to be easy," he said.
                <br>
                <br>
                Why? A key piece of coronavirus health advice has been to do things outside.<br>
                This gets more difficult as temperatures slip. Instead, cold weather will drive<br> 
                people indoors to closer quarters with potentially poor ventilation, where the<br> 
                risk of spread is heightened.
                <br>
                <br>
                What's more, viruses tend to survive more easily in cold conditions.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are now additional fears that the virus will collide with the US influenza<br> 
                season - which typically begins in October - threatening to overwhelm the<br> 
                health system.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b style="font-size: 30px;">Are deaths still falling?</b> 
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's some good news - virus deaths in the US are continuing to fall, albeit<br> 
                gradually.
                <br>
                <br>
                As of early October, the daily average had reached around 720, a marked drop<br> 
                from the staggering 1,000-plus daily fatalities recorded this summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                But the bad news? This decline appears to have slowed in recent weeks. And<br> 
                recent daily tallies suggest some ground has been lost since the record lows of<br> 
                early July.
                <br>
                <br>
                In total, over 210,000 people have died of Covid-19 across the US, according<br> 
                to data from Johns Hopkins University.
