            Technology firms including Microsoft have tried to disrupt a cybercriminal group whose<br> 
            malicious software has been used in ransomware attacks and other hacks around the world, the companies said Wednesday.<br><br>
            The effort included a court order from the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia<br> 
            that allowed Microsoft (MSFT) to seize 65 internet domains used by the hacking group behind widely used malware known as ZLoader, Microsoft said.<br><br>
            Since surfacing in 2019, ZLoader has been used in an array of financially motivated hacking<br> 
            schemes â€” many of them aimed at organizations in North America. The hackers have also been<br> 
            involved in a tool for deploying a type of ransomware that has to be used in hacks against health care organizations, according to Microsoft.<br><br>
            Microsoft said it identified one of the people involved in the hacking enterprise and that it referred information to law enforcement authorities.<br><br>
            The US Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.<br><br>
            Other cybersecurity firms involved in the takedown included US companies Lumen and Palo Alto Networks, and Slovakia-based ESET.<br><br>
            It's just the latest corporate or government effort to dismantle computer infrastructure,<br> 
            which is often registered in the United States, used by cybercriminals or intelligence operatives.<br><br>
            Microsoft said last week that it had used another court order to disable seven internet domains<br> 
            that a hacking group linked with Russian intelligence was using in a likely effort to support Russia's war in Ukraine.<br><br>
            The actions are far from fatal blows to the hacking groups, but it's an important effort to make it harder for them to operate.<br><br>
            "Each time we have a successful takedown like this, we increase the cost for them to do business<br> 
            and set the example for their successors that there is increased risk associated with their malicious activities,"<br> 
            said Wendi Whitmore, head of Palo Alto Network's Unit 42 threat intelligence section.
