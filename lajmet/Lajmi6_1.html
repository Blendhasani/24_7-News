            If you have a history of asthma or allergies, you may be at increased risk of developing high<br> 
            blood pressure and coronary heart disease, new research finds.<br><br>
            Adults between the ages of 18 and 57 who have suffered from an allergic disorder had a higher risk of high blood pressure,<br> 
            according to the research, which will be presented at the American College of Cardiology and Korean Society of Cardiology's<br> 
            spring conference in Gyeongju,South Korea.<br><br>
            The highest risk for high blood pressure was found among people with asthma, researchers said.<br><br>
            High blood pressure and cholesterol, along with a lack of exercise, obesity, diabetes, smoking and a family history of cardiovascular issues,<br> 
            are all key contributors to heart disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br><br>
            <h3><b>Asthma highest risk</b></h3><br>
            Previous studies have also found a correlation between allergic disorders and heart disease,<br> 
            but the link was controversial, the researchers said. In this latest research, scientists tested their hypothesis<br> 
            using data on over 10,000 people with allergies who participated in the 2012 National Health Interview Survey,<br> 
            a government-led survey of the United States population.<br><br>
            Each person had asthma or at least one allergic disorder, such as a respiratory, food or skin allergy.<br><br>
            In addition to the risk for high blood pressure, the research also found a higher risk for coronary heart disease for people<br> 
            between the ages of 39 and 57 with allergies. Coronary heart disease occurs when plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart.<br><br>
            Based on their findings, researcher encouraged clinicians to add a cardiovascular risk assessment to clinical examinations of people with asthma and allergies.<br><br>
            "For patients with allergic disorders, routine evaluation of blood pressure and routine examination for coronary heart disease<br> 
            should be given by clinicians to ensure early treatments are given to those with hypertension or coronary heart disease,"<br> 
            said lead study author Yang Guo, a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital in China, in a statement.
