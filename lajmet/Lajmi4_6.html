            A SpaceX rocket carrying three paying customers and a former NASA astronaut took off from Kennedy<br> 
            Space Center in Florida on Friday morning, kicking off a first-of-its-kind mission that will take<br> 
            the group on a 10-day mission to the International Space Station.<br><br>
            The spacecraft, which separated from the rocket after reaching orbit, is now free flying through<br> 
            orbit and will spend all day Friday slowly maneuvering closer to the ISS, where it's slated to dock Saturday around 7:45 am ET.<br><br>
            The trip was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which seeks to book<br> 
            rocket rides, provide all the necessary training, and coordinate flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it.<br> 
            It's all in line with the US government's and the private sector's goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond.<br><br>
            On board this mission, called AX-1, are Michael Lopez-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut turned Axiom<br> 
            employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor<br> 
            Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.<br><br>
            It's not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS,<br> 
            as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft for various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.<br> 
            But this is the first mission that includes a crew entirely comprised of private citizens<br> 
            with no active members of a government astronaut corps. It's also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.<br><br>
            <h3>How much did this all cost?</h3>
            Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company<br> 
            declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission — beyond saying in a press conference<br> 
            last year that the price is in the "tens of millions."<br><br>
            The mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.<br><br>
            And the space agency has revealed some details on how much it'll charge for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.<br><br>
            Food alone costs $2,000 per day, per person, in space. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a<br> 
            commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day. For each mission, bringing on the<br> 
            necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers another $5.2 million, and all the<br> 
            mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million.
