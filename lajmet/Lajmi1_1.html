       <b> UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, speaking after a summit in Liverpool, said the <br>group wanted Russia to stop its aggression towards Ukraine</b>
       <br><br> However President Putin told President Biden during their video call last week that Russian troops <br>did not pose a threat to anyone, Russian media report.
       <br><br>Tensions are growing as Moscow amasses troops on Ukraine's border.
       <br>
       <br>
       Mr Putin added that he had no particular grounds for optimism after speaking to Mr Biden,<br> but would like to meet him in person, local media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.
      <br><br> Russia and the US continue to have serious conceptual differences, Mr Peskov added.

       Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether Mr Putin has made a decision.
       
      <br><br> On Tuesday Mr Biden and Mr Putin held a virtual summit aimed at reducing tensions in the region.  
      <br><br> Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin that there would be "economic consequences like none he's ever seen" if he invaded Ukraine.

      <br><br>On Sunday the G7 echoed that, saying: <b>"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response."</b>
      <br><br>However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border.
