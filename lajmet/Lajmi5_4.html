            Researchers have finally deciphered a complete human genetic instruction book from cover to cover.<br><br>
            The completion of the human genome has been announced a couple of times in the past, but those were<br> 
            actually incomplete drafts. “We really mean it this time,” says Evan Eichler, a human geneticist and Howard<br> 
            Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Washington in Seattle.<br><br>
            The completed genome is presented in a series of papers published online March 31 in Science and Nature Methods.<br><br>
            An international team of researchers, including Eichler, used new DNA sequencing technology to untangle<br> 
            repetitive stretches of DNA that were redacted from an earlier version of the genome, widely used<br> 
            as a reference for guiding biomedical research.<br><br>
            Deciphering those tricky stretches adds about 200 million DNA bases, about 8 percent of the genome, to the<br> 
            instruction book, researchers report in Science. That’s essentially an entire chapter. And it’s a juicy one,<br> 
            containing the first-ever looks at the short arms of some chromosomes, long-lost genes and important parts of<br> 
            chromosomes called centromeres — where machinery responsible for divvying up DNA grips the chromosome.<br><br>
            “Some of the regions that were missing actually turn out to be the most interesting,” says Rajiv McCoy, a human<br> 
            geneticist at Johns Hopkins University, who was part of the team known as the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T)<br> 
            Consortium assembling the complete genome. “It’s exciting because we get to take the first look inside these<br> 
            regions and see what we can find.” Telomeres are repetitive stretches of DNA found at the ends of<br> 
            chromosomes. Like aglets on shoelaces, they may help keep chromosomes from unraveling.<br><br>
            Data from the effort are already available for other researchers to explore. And some, like geneticist Ting Wang<br> 
            of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, have already delved in. “Having a complete genome<br> 
            reference definitely improves biomedical studies.… It’s an extremely useful resource,” he says.<br> 
            “There’s no question that this is an important achievement.”<br><br>
            But, Wang says, “the human genome isn’t quite complete yet.”<br><br>
            To understand why and what this new volume of the human genetic encyclopedia tells us, here’s a closer look at the milestone.
