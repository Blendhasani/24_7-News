                    Conor Benn's knockout win over Chris Algieri on Saturday and discuss<br>
                    what's next for the British welterweight.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
        Plus, there's reaction to wins for boxing superstars Katie Taylor and Vasiliy Lomachenko,<br> 
        and Tyson Fury is up to his old tricks as he takes the mic to sing happy birthday to<br> 
        promoter Bob Arum before coming face-to-face with fellow heavyweight champion<br> 
        Oleksandr Usyk in New York.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="font-size: 25px;">'The most improved fighter in the UK'</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        From the moment Conor Benn turned professional in April 2016, the welterweight had a<br> 
        point to prove.
        <br>
        <br>
        Son of Britain's beloved former world champion Nigel Benn, with the surname came both<br> 
        added expectation and scrutiny.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2018, in his 10th professional bout, Benn was floored twice in the opening round en<br> 
        route to a points win over Frenchman Cedrick Peynaud.
        <br>
        <br>
        With just 22 amateur bouts under his belt and already showing vulnerability in the<br> 
        professional ranks, few - if any - fans felt Benn would ever step out of the shadows of his<br> 
        dad.
        <br>
        <br>
        But over the past 13 months, Benn has silenced those critics. He followed an impressive<br> 
        decision win over Germany's Sebastian Formella in November 2020 with an explosive<br> 
        first-round knockout victory over Colombian Samuel Vargas - a man who had floored Amir<br> 
        Khan - in April.
        <br>
        <br>
        In September, Benn put in a disciplined performance to beat American Adrian Granados<br> 
        on points.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then on Saturday night in Liverpool, the 25-year-old stopped former world champion Chris<br> 
        Algieri with a fourth-round highlight reel knockout that showcased power and technical<br> 
        ability.
        <br>
        <br>
        Algieri's only previous defeats were against Briton Khan, Filipino great Manny Pacquiao<br> 
        and undefeated American superstar Errol Spence Jr.
        <br>
        <br>
        At 37, the American's best days may be well behind him, but Benn's clinical display<br> 
        demonstrated the Briton's credentials at the top level.
        <br>
        <br>
        Benn's performance and improvements in the professional game earned the praise of<br> 
        these former world championsâ€¦
