            Europa's frozen surface is covered with distinctive pairs of ridges that straddle troughs of ice.<br> 
            These double ridges are the most common features on the Jovian moon. But scientists don't yet have a clear idea of how the oddities are created.<br><br>
            Now, an analysis of images of a similar set of ridges on Greenland’s ice sheet suggests that relatively shallow<br> 
            water within Europa’s thick icy shell may be behind their formation, scientists report April 19<br> 
            in Nature Communications. If so, that could mean that Europa has much more shallow liquid water than scientists have thought.<br><br>
            Europa’s double ridge systems, which can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, include some of the oldest<br> 
            features on the moon, says Riley Culberg, a geophysicist at Stanford University. Some researchers have<br> 
            proposed that the flexing of the moon’s icy shell due to tides in an underlying liquid water ocean plays a role<br> 
            in the ridges’ formation (SN: 8/6/20). Yet others have suggested that water erupted from deep within the icy moon<br> 
            — a process known as cryovolcanism — to create the ridges. Without a closer look, though,<br> 
            it’s been hard to nail down a more solid explanation.<br><br>
            But Culberg and his colleagues seem to have caught a break. Data gathered by NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite in<br> 
            March 2016 showed an 800-meter-long double ridge system in northwestern Greenland. So the team looked<br> 
            back at other images to see when the ridge system first appeared and to assess how it grew. The researchers<br> 
            found that the ridges appeared in images taken as early as July 2013 and are still there today.<br><br>
            When the ridges — which lie on either side of a trough, like those on Europa — reached full size, they averaged<br> 
            only 2.1 meters high. That’s a lot smaller than the ridges on Europa, which can rise 300 meters or more from the<br> 
            moon’s surface. But surface gravity is much lower on Europa, so ridges can grow much larger there, Culberg<br> 
            says. When he and his colleagues considered the difference between Earth’s gravity and Europa’s in their<br> 
            calculations, they found that the proportions of the two ridge systems are consistent.
