        <b>When Swiss watch boss, Christoph Grainger-Herr, was unable fly to a global trade show in China
             because of Covid-19 restrictions, <br> he decided to beam in Star Trek-style instead.</b> 
        <br><br>Mr Grainger-Herr, the chief executive of luxury brand IWC, <br> had been due to travel to the Watches and Wonders event in Shanghai back in April.   
        <br><br>When that became impossible, instead, he decided to joined the show as a life-size, 3D hologram.<br> Appearing in 4K resolution, he was able to talk to, and see and hear the people who were physically attending the event.  
        <br><br>"We beamed him from his office in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, to the event in Shanghai," says David Nussbaum, the boss of US holograms firm Portl.
        <br><br>"He did his thing, chatted to other executives, and even unveiled a new watch, <br> all in real time. And then we beamed him out again!"
        <br><br>With the coronavirus pandemic having put a stop to much global travel since March 2020, it has fuelled a growing interest in the use of holograms - 3D <br>light projections of a person - as a more life-like, more immersive, more sensory alternative to video calls.
        <br><br>Los-Angeles-based Portl is one of the firms at the forefront of the technology, <br>and Mr Nussbaum says "we can't make our portals fast enough"
        <br><br>Its portals are eight feet (2.5m) tall, glass-fronted, computerised boxes. <br>Inside the booths a life-size hologram of a person appears.
