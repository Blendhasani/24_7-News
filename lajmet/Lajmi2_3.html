                The NHS says people should look out for classic Covid symptoms:<br><br>
                <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
                <li>a fever/high temperature</li>
                <li>loss of or change to smell or taste  </li>
            </ul>
            </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            But researchers say for some people, having Covid can feel "more like a bad<br> 
                cold" with symptoms such as a headache, sore throat and a runny nose.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you think you may have Covid, it is important to get tested. Even people who<br> 
            don't feel very ill can put others at risk.
            <br>
            <br>

             <span style="font-size: 30px;">Does a fever mean I have coronavirus?</span> <!--mos harro mi kqyr qeto-->
            <br>
            <br>
            A high temperature is 37.8C or above. A fever like this can happen when the<br> 
            body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is best to use a thermometer. But if you don't have one, check if you, or the<br> 
            person you are worried about, feels hot to the touch on the chest or back.
            <br>
            <br>
            A high temperature is unlikely with a cold.
            <br>
            <br>

           
           
            
            If you have a cold or flu you may well have a cough, along with other<br> 
            symptoms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Flu usually comes on suddenly and sufferers will often experience muscle<br> 
            aches, chills, headaches, tiredness, a sore throat and a runny or stuffed nose,<br> 
            along with the cough. It feels worse than a heavy cold.
            <br>
            <br>
            Colds tend to develop more gradually and are less severe, although they do<br> 
            still make you feel unwell. Along with a cough, there may be sneezing and a<br> 
            sore throat and runny nose. Fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches are rare.
            <br>
            <br>
            A coronavirus cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or<br> 
            more coughing fits or "episodes" in 24 hours.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you usually have a cough because of a long-standing medical condition like<br> 
            COPD, it may be worse than usual.
            <br>
            <br>
            You should get tested for coronavirus if you develop a new, continuous cough.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 30px;">What do loss or change to smell or taste mean?</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            These are key symptoms of coronavirus and mean you should get a test.
            <br>
            <br>
            It could still be that you have a simple cold. But you need to check, even if you<br> 
            don't feel unwell, to avoid the risk of spreading the virus.
