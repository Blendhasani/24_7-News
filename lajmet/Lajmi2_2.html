                <b>Existing vaccines should still protect people who contract the Omicron<br> 
                    variant from severe Covid cases, a World Health Organization (WHO) official<br> 
                    says.</b>
                <br>
                <br>    
                It comes as the first lab tests of the new variant in South Africa suggest it can<br> 
                partially evade the Pfizer jab.
                <br>
                <br>
                Researchers say there was a "very large drop" in how well the vaccine's<br> 
                antibodies neutralised the new strain.
                <br>
                <br>
                But the WHO's Dr Mike Ryan said there was no sign Omicron would be better<br> 
                at evading vaccines than other variants.
                <br>
                <br>
                "We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the<br> 
                variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation, and there's no<br> 
                reason to expect that it wouldn't be so" for Omicron, Dr Ryan, the WHO's<br> 
                emergencies director, told AFP news agency.
                <br>
                <br>
                He said initial data suggested Omicron did not make people sicker than the<br> 
                Delta and other strains. "If anything, the direction is towards less severity," he<br> 
                said.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><u>The new South African study</u></b> - which has not yet been peer-reviewed - found<br> 
                the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may result in up to 40 times fewer neutralising<br>
                antibodies against Omicron than against the original Covid strain.
                <br>
                <br>
                But Omicron's ability to escape vaccine antibodies is "incomplete", said Prof<br> 
                Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute, who led the<br> 
                research.
                <br>
                <br>
                He said the results, based on blood tests from 12 people, were "better than I<br> 
                expected of Omicron".
                <br>
                <br>
                Prof Sigal said vaccination, combined with previous infection, could still<br> 
                neutralise against the variant. That suggests boosters may bring a significant<br> 
                benefit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Scientists believe previous infection, followed by vaccination or a booster, is<br> 
                likely to increase the neutralisation level and will probably protect people<br> 
                against severe disease.
